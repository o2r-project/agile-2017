# Reproducible Research @ AGILE

This website is home of workshops and an [AGILE INITIATIVE](https://agile-online.org/funding-initiatives) on the topic of [Reproducible Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research) in connection with the [Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe's](https://agile-online.org/) (AGILE) [annual conference series](https://agile-online.org/past-conferences-and-proceedings).

- **[Reproducibility review 2021](2021)**
  (Due to the obligations with the reproducibiltiy review, no workshops around the topic of reproducibility will take place. If you are interested in coorganising a workshop next year, [please get in touch](https://discourse.agile-online.org/t/workshops-around-the-reproducible-paper-guidelines/54).)
- [Short paper postprints](short-paper-postprints)
- [Reproducibility review 2020](2020)
- [Reproducible Publications at AGILE Conferences](initiative) (initiative & meeting, 2018-2019)
- [Reproducible Research](2019) (workshop, 2019)
- [Reproducible Research Publications](2018) (workshop, 2018)
- [Reproducible Geosciences Discussion Forum](2017) (workshop, 2017)

## About

Reproducibility and replicability of research gains more attention each year across many domains, some of which even struggle with a "reproducibility crisis".
However, at AGILE conferences, the topic is underrepresented.
Recent research found that none of the last years nominees for best papers (both short & full papers) provided sufficient information (i.e. instructions, data, and code) to be reproduced independently by a third party.

Learn more about the state of reproducibility at AGILE and what can be done about it in the peer-reviewed article **"Reproducible research and GIScience: an evaluation using AGILE conference papers"** at [https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5072](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5072).
Read more about past, ongoing, and future activities & strategy in the preprint **"Reproducible Research is like riding a bike"** at [https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.27216v1](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.27216v1) presented at the 5th Open Source Geospatial Research and Education Symposium ([OGRS 2018](http://2018.ogrs-community.org/)).

The workshops are organised by a group of Open Science and Reproducible Research enthusiasts.
They introduce interested scientists and developers to the concepts of reproducible research, raise awareness of challenges around computational reproducibility in science within the AGILE community, and give hands-on guidance on how to increase the degree of reproducibility for the participant's own work.
