# Reproducible Research @ AGILE '20

The AGILE council has decided to cancel the AGILE 2020 Conference, see [the conference website with more infos](https://agile-online.org/conference-2020).
The full papers will still be published and _the reproducibility review of accepted full papers will still take place_, see [Reproducibility Review](#reproducibility-review).

## Reproducibility Review

### Report

- The reproducibility committee updated the [review process schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHCQV7GP3YkKwp0Nii3dt3p3Y45hU56Xz2cr-xJVz34/edit#) in collaboration with the publisher and created a report on the results and lessons learned from the 2020 reproducibility review. Find the updated process description and the report at **[https://osf.io/vq34n/](https://osf.io/vq34n/)**.
- Daniel reported on the status of the AGILE conference reproducibility review at the online AGILE General Meeting on June 23, 2020. See the [slides](https://bit.ly/agile2020-repro-review-slides) and the [slides PDF with full speaker notes](/public/files/agile2020_repro-review-report_AGILE-General-Meeting-2020-06-23.pdf) for details.

### Reproducibility Committee

## ~~Workshops~~ (cancelled)

~~**Workshops at the [23rd AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science](https://agile-online.org/conference-2020/), Chania, Crete, Greece on 16 June, 2020**.~~

This year, the [team](#organizing-committee) of the [workshop series](../) organises two half-day workshops.
In the morning, an introduction to reproducible research by means of the AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines.
In the afternoon, a practical application of these guidelines.
With this split, we hope to address different interests and skill levels adequately.
If you're curious, take a look at the submitted workshop proposals ([1](../public/files/agile2020_workshop-proposal_introduction-to-reproducible-research.pdf)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[2](../public/files/agile2020_workshop-proposal_reproducible-research-in-practice.pdf)) about our objectives, reasoning, and planned outcomes.

_You must register for either or both workshops [on the conference website](https://agile-online.org/conference-2020/registration-2020) until May 11 2020!_

### Introduction to reproducible research by means of the new AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines

Reproducibility, replicability, and transparency are widely recognised as crucial topics forscholarly research.
This half day workshop teaches participants concepts and best practicesfor reproducible research.
The workshop prepares participants for the future of research publications by means of presenting the AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines in detail, demonstrating common tools for reproducible research, and discussing participants' questions and own experiences in the light of reproducibility.

In the GIScience community, the AGILE conference is leading the endeavour towards higher reproducibility with establishing the [_AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines_](​https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CB7Z8​) for the 2020 conference.
The guidelines include detailed information about rationale, motivation and vision of reproducible publications at AGILE Conferences.
They also link numerous resources for detailed and specific practices, e.g. for social media data, personal data, or workflows in specific programming languages.
After the workshop, participants will have a good understanding of the rationale behind the guidelines and the different aspects of data, code, and environments that matter for reproducibility.
They will have an overview of the practical challenges in modern data- and code-based scholarly communication, and an understanding of the authors' and reviewers' perspectives.

_[Registration](https://agile-online.org/conference-2020/registration-2020) is open until May 11 2020._

The practical aspects of reproducibility are covered in a [second workshop in the afternoon](#reproducible-research-in-practice-the-agile-reproducible-paper-guidelines-in-action).

### Reproducible research in practice: the AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines in action

Reproducibility of research is not a black and white question.
A spectrum of reproducibility exists, only some works fall short of the ideal due to relevant limitations but most due to lack of knowledge, incentives, and skills.
In this workshop, participants learn the tools and habits to improve reproducibility of their work, and how to create and publish knowledge in an open and transparent way.
The workshop covers literate programming with Jupyter and R Markdown notebooks, and proactive management and sharing of computing environments (hardware, software dependencies, containerisation). 

Participants benefit most from the workshop if they are familiar with scripted workflows in either R or Python.
During the workshop the diversity of tools and practical tips'n'tricks are explored, including practical application of the most useful ones.
The skills acquired at the workshop will allow participants to work closer to the "ideal" level of reproducibility as presented in the [_AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines_](​https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CB7Z8​) (see the blue column for "ideal" practices), greatly improve efficiency and transparency in their daily work habits, and enable new ways to collaborate with others.
Participants will have the opportunity to share own experiences and learn from the mutual exchange.

_[Registration](https://agile-online.org/conference-2020/registration-2020) is open until May 11 2020._

The workshop assumes familiarity with the basics of reproducible research. These are introduced in depth in [a workshop in the morning](#introduction-to-reproducible-research-by-means-of-the-new-agile-reproducible-paper-guidelines) or can be acquired beforehand, e.g. by studying the AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines.

### Workshops Code of Conduct

> To ensure a welcoming environment for all, we require everyone participating in the workshop to conform to the Code of Conduct given below.
> This code applies to all spaces related to the workshop including, but not limited to, workshop venue, emails, shared documents, and code repositories.
> We strongly recommend that anyone running workshops or classes of any kind choose and publish a similar code so that everyone will know what is expected of them and what to do when those expectations are not met.

You can report Code of Conduct violations anonymously via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8eXwMHpHQIbj4BptImIDCDlBgRZeq1mEtKBEglxpoIIkpZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) or in person to Barbara Hofer or Carlos Granell (who have access to the anonymous reports besides Daniel Nüst).

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
However, we recognize that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged.
Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, color, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort.
Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions.
Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behavior in our community, regardless of intent.
Prohibited harassing behavior includes but is not limited to:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation;
- the display of sexual or violent images;
- unwelcome sexual attention;
- non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact;
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications;
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop; and
- publication of private communication without consent.

Behavior not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment.
The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.
All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
